# piu
This project is a game based in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS of a VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rythm Game) using keys as the pads imitating the 5 pad system of PIU. 

Plans for this game is to turn it into an online multiplayer version where you can compete against each other with the help of NodeJS, Express and SocketIO. Changing the styling of the game to VueJS may be attempted in the future.
