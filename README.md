# Nujim Prototpye
This project is a game based in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS of a VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rythm Game) using keys as the pads imitating the 5 pad system of PIU. Inspiration behind the game was from a DDR/PIU dancepad and how playing the game heavily relied on movement which did not feel well utilised with arrow keys. The designated numpad allows for a similar grid to that of PIU and would make hand positioning more important. 

Plans for this game is to turn it into an online multiplayer version where you can compete against each other with the help of NodeJS and Express. Hosting the game through Firebase has removed the functionality of multiplayer and lobby connections.

After becoming more experienced in React, future plans would be recreate the game using new found knowledge of React and Databases to make multiplayer functionality viable. Other areas of improvement are beat map creation, interface and optimisation.

Prototype can be found here:

* The game uses the song Psycho by Red Velvet as a placeholder for testing and is very loud.
* The game is poorly optimised in terms of rendering and will be worked on in a future reworked version.
